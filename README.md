## React App for calculating sleep time score
My priority in this project was UX and making sure I tested functions and components as I would for
a proper task. I used create-react-app to bootstrap this project, and antd components since I'm familiar
with them. I did my best to separate the setup from the code (commit wise), but I think I included some setup
in the more code focused commits.

I worked on this here and there throughout a workday, so I don't know exactly how much time I spent on it,
but I committed more time than is probably appropriate on testing the selectors with react-testing-library ðŸ™ƒ.
I am comfortable saying I didn't commit too much time on the rest of the project (falling within
the expected completion time).

Thank you for taking the time to review this ðŸŽ‰\
